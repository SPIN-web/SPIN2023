# Call for Papers

The 29th edition of the SPIN symposium aims to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in automated tool-based techniques to analyze and model software for the purpose of verification and validation. The symposium specifically focuses on concurrent software but does not exclude the analysis of sequential software. Submissions are solicited on theoretical results, novel algorithms (classical and quantum), tool development for modern hardware (parallel and distributed), and empirical evaluation.
