# Call for Papers

The 29th edition of the SPIN symposium aims to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in automated tool-based techniques to analyze and model software for the purpose of verification and validation.
We invite submissions presenting theoretical results, novel algorithms, tool development, and empirical evaluation.
The proceedings of SPIN 2023 will be published in Springer's *Lecture Notes in Computer Science* series.

## Submission Guidelines

* [Submission website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spin20230)
* [LNCS template and formatting instructions](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)

With the exception of survey and history papers, submissions should contain original work.
Submitted work must not have been submitted concurrently or accepted for publication elsewhere.
Submissions should adhere to the [LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
We invite both **long** (up to 16 pages) and **short** (up to 6 pages) papers (not including references and appendices).
SPIN 2023 uses a **single-blind** policy, so submissions need not be anonymized.

We ask authors to submit an **abstract** prior to the full paper.
Abstracts and full papers are submitted via the [EasyChair submission website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spin20230).
The **dates** (understood as [Anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)) for submitting the abstract and the full paper are given on the side bar (click the entry to see a conversion to local time).

All papers conforming to the submission guidelines will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee.
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.

At least one author of each accepted paper must **attend** the symposium and present the paper.
Please note that SPIN 2023 adheres to the policy of ETAPS 2023 with regards to physical participation, and this policy is subject to change based on the situation.
